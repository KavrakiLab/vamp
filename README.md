This repository hosts the code for the ICRA 2024 paper [‚ÄúMotions in Microseconds via Vectorized Sampling-Based Planning‚Äù](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14545) as well as an implementation of the Collision-Affording Point Tree (CAPT) from the forthcoming RSS 2024 paper [‚ÄúCollision-Affording Point Trees: SIMD-Amenable Nearest Neighbors for Fast Collision Checking‚Äù](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02807).

**TL;DR**: By exploiting ubiquitous [CPU SIMD instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) to accelerate collision checking and forward kinematics (FK), `vamp`'s RRT-Connect [[1]](#1) solves problems for the Franka Emika Panda from the MotionBenchMaker dataset [[3]](#3) at a median speed of 35 microseconds (on one core of a consumer desktop PC).
This approach to hardware-accelerated parallel sampling-based motion planning extends to other planning algorithms without modification (e.g., PRM [[2]](#2)) and also works on low-power systems (e.g., an ARM-based [OrangePi](http://www.orangepi.org/)).
We also accelerate collision checking against pointclouds with a novel spatial data structure, the Collision-Affording Point Tree (CAPT), which has an average query time of less than 10 nanoseconds on 3D scenes composed of thousands of points.

## Building and Installing

VAMP requires the following system dependencies:
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.16 or greater.
- GCC 8+ or Clang 10+, along with the C++ standard library.
  To install GCC on Ubuntu, `sudo apt install build-essential`.
  To install Clang and its C++ standard library implementation on Ubuntu 22.04, `sudo apt install clang libstdc++6`
- Python development headers for generating Python bindings.
  We support Python 3.8 and above.
  To install on Ubuntu 22.04, `sudo apt install python3-dev`.
- [`Eigen3`](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) for some vector/matrix operations.
  To install on Ubuntu 22.04, `sudo apt install libeigen3-dev`.

VAMP fetches the following external dependencies via [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake):
- [`nanobind`](https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind): for Python bindings
- [`nigh`](https://github.com/KavrakiLab/nigh): a fork of the original [`nigh`](https://github.com/UNC-Robotics/nigh) [[4]](#4) to better use our vector types
- [`pdqsort`](https://github.com/orlp/pdqsort): for fast sorting
- [`SIMDxorshift`](https://github.com/lemire/SIMDxorshift): alternative fast random numbers for x86 machines


Download the code and submodules:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:KavrakiLab/vamp.git
```
### Python
For use through Python, install with `pip`:
```bash
cd vamp
pip install .
```
If you want to install all Python dependencies to run the examples, specify those optional dependencies:
```bash
pip install .[examples,heightmaps]
```
If you have installed the `examples` dependencies, test your installation by running:
```bash
python scripts/sphere_cage_example.py --visualize
```
Which will benchmark a simple scenario of the Franka Emika Panda in a cage of spheres and visualize one of the results.
See the [README in the scripts directory](scripts/README.md) for more details.

### C++
If you wish to extend `vamp` via C++, please build directly with CMake, e.g.:
```
cd vamp
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
cmake --build build
```
Please see `CMakeLists.txt` for further build configuration options.

### Docker
We provide example dockerfiles in `docker/` that show installation on Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, and 24.04.

### Conda/Mamba
Installation in [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)/[Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) environments is supported.
See the `environment.yaml` file for a basic environment, and see `docker/ubuntu2204-conda.dockerfile` for an example installation.

### Supported Platforms
We currently support x86 CPUs (e.g., Intel, AMD) with the [AVX2 vector instruction set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) and ARM CPUs (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Mac M1) with [NEON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family#Advanced_SIMD_(Neon)).
Please see the `docker/` folder for reference installation procedures.

### Using Clang instead of GCC
You can force the use of Clang instead of GCC for compiling VAMP by uncommenting the line at the bottom of the `pyproject.toml` (or setting the corresponding CMake variable for C++ builds):
```toml
[tool.scikit-build.cmake.define]
VAMP_LTO = "ON"
VAMP_FORCE_CLANG = "ON"
```

This may have performance implications for some systems (positive or negative).
We recommend trying both compilers to see which works best for your particular setup.

## Supported Robots
We ship code to do planning for a sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and the UR5, Panda, Fetch, and Baxter models as found in [`robowflex_resources`](https://github.com/KavrakiLab/robowflex_resources) [[5]](#5), as used in the MotionBenchMaker (MBM) [[3]](#3) dataset.
Resources for each robot (URDF, SRDF, meshes, etc.) are all provided in the `resources/` directory under each robot's name.
See the [README](resources/README.md) for more information on the robot models.

The MBM problems for each robot are compressed in `problems.tar.bz2`.
For the UR5, Panda, and Fetch, these problems are the `table_pick`, `table_under_pick`, `box`, `bookshelf_small`, `bookshelf_tall`, `bookshelf_thin`, and `cage` scenarios, each with 100 problems.
For the Baxter, these problems are `bookshelf_tall_both_arms_easy`, `bookshelf_tall_both_arms_medium`, and `bookshelf_tall_both_arms_hard` scenarios, each with 600 problems (note that the difficulty modifier refers to the amount of variation in the scene, not difficulty of finding a problem solution).
These problems can be decompressed into a convenient [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) and JSON format with the script `resources/problem_tar_to_pkl_json.py`, after VAMP has been installed:
```bash
# choose robot name from {ur5, panda, fetch, baxter}
python resources/problem_tar_to_pkl_json.py --robot panda
```
This only needs to be run once.

Each robot in VAMP is provided as a Python submodule (e.g., `vamp.panda`, `vamp.fetch`) and supports the following functions:
- `rrtc`: RRT-Connect. See [Supported Planners](#Supported-Planners)
- `prm`: PRM. See [Supported Planners](#Supported-Planners)
- `roadmap`: returns the constructed roadmap generated by PRM
- `simplify`: simplifies a planned path
- `validate`: checks if a standalone configuration in collision
- `sphere_validity`: returns a list, for each sphere in the robot model, of the names of all objects currently colliding with the sphere
- `fk`: performs FK to compute the locations of all robot collision spheres
- `filter_from_pointcloud`: removes points in the pointcloud that are currently in collision with the robot (i.e., points which probably belong to the robot, if the robot is in a known valid configuration)

For the flying sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$, additional operations are available to set the domain of the sphere and the radius:
- `vamp.sphere.set_lows()` and `vamp.sphere.set_highs()` to set bounding box of space
- `vamp.sphere.set_radius()` to set the sphere's radius

## Supported Planners
We currently ship two planners:
- `rrtc`, which is an implementation of a dynamic-domain [[6]](#6) balanced [[7]](#7) RRT-Connect [[1]](#1).
- `prm`, which is an implementation of basic PRM [[2]](#2) (i.e., PRM without the bounce heuristic, etc.).

Note that these planners support planning to a set of goals, not just a single goal.
Also, all planners use a multi-dimensional Halton sequence for deterministic planning [[12-13]](#12).

We also ship a number of heuristic simplification routines:
- randomized and deterministic shortcutting [[8, 9]](#8) (`REDUCE` and `SHORTCUT`)
- B-spline smoothing [[10]](#10) (`BSPLINE`)
- randomized perturbation [[11]](#11) (`PERTURB`).
These routines heuristically attempt to shorten the total path length in configuration space.
See the `src/impl/vamp/planning/` folder for more information.

### Planner Configuration and Hyperparameters
We provide a helper function `vamp.configure_robot_and_planner_with_kwargs(robot, planner, **kwargs)` to help configure all the planner and simplification settings that are available.
Scripts that use this helper (`sphere_cage_example.py`, `evaluate_mbm.py`, `visualize_mbm.py`) provide the following arguments:
- `--robot`: Specify the robot to use. See [Supported Robots](#Supported-Robots) for names.
- `--planner`: Planner name, either `rrtc` or `prm`.

Each planner supports a number of settings. Both support the following:
- `--max_iterations`: maximum planner iterations.
- `--max_samples`: maximum samples planner can allocate.
- `--rng_skip_iterations`: skip this many samples from the RNG before planning.

For `rrtc`:
- `--range`: RRT extension range. Set to sensible default for each robot, usually something in [0.5, 2].
- `--dynamic_domain`: `True` or `False`, enables [dynamic domain](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1570709) sample filtering.
- `--radius`: initial restricted radius for dynamic domain. Usually between [0.5, 5].
- `--alpha`: update parameter to shrink/grow dynamic domain. Usually between [0.00001, 0.01]
- `--min_radius`: minimum radius of dynamic domain. Usually between [0.5, 1]
- `--balance`: `True` or `False`, enables tree balancing.
- `--tree_ratio`: ratio of tree sizes at which trees are swapped. 1 is perfect balancing.
- `--start_tree_first`: `True` or `False`, grow from start tree or goal tree first.
See `rrtc_settings.hh` for more information.

For `prm`, the settings must be configured with a neighbor parameter structure, e.g.:
```py
robot_module = vamp.panda # or other robot submodule
prmstar_params = vamp.PRMNeighborParams(robot_module.dimension(), robot_module.space_measure())
prm_settings = vamp.PRMSettings(prmstar_params)
```
This is handled by default in the configuration function.

For simplification:
- `--simplification_operations`: sequence of shortcutting heuristics to apply each iteration. By default, `[SHORTCUT,BSPLINE]`. Can specify any sequence of the above keys.
- `--max_iterations`: maximum iterations of simplification. If no heuristics do any work, then early terminates from simplification.
- `--bspline_max_steps`: maximum iterations of B-spline smoothing.
- `--bspline_min_change`: minimum change before smoothing is done.
- `--bspline_midpoint_interpolation`: point along each axis B-spline interpolation is done from.
- `--reduce_max_steps`: maximum iterations of randomized vertex reduction.
- `--reduce_max_empty_steps`: maximum no-op iterations of randomized vertex reduction.
- `--reduce_range_ratio`: range from [0, 1] as ratio of entire path that randomized shortcuts are attempted.
- `--perturb_max_steps`: maximum iterations of randomized perturbations.
- `--perturb_max_empty_steps`: maximum no-op iterations of randomized perturbations.
- `--perturb_perturbation_attempts`: maximum number of attempts per iteration of perturbation.
- `--perturb_range`: range vertices are perturbed.
See `simplify_settings.hh` for more information.

## Environment Representation

VAMP currently supports collision checking against primitive models of the environment and pointclouds via CAPTs (see [planned features](#Planned-Features) for forthcoming extensions to meshes, etc.).
Environments (`vamp.Environment`) can be constructed by adding objects (`add_sphere(vamp.Sphere(...))`, etc.).
These objects can be created with the following:
- `vamp.Sphere(position, radius)`: a sphere with position and radius.
- `vamp.Capsule(center, euler_xyz, radius, length)` and `vamp.Capsule(endpoint1, endpoint2, radius)`: a capsule in space, specified by either its frame, radius, and length or by the endpoints and radius.
- `vamp.Cuboid(center, euler_xyz, half_extents)`: a cuboid specified by the frame and then half-extents (radii) along the X, Y, and Z axes in its local frame.
- `vamp.Heightfield` via `vamp.make_heightfield` / `vamp.png_to_heightfield`: a heightfield specified by pixel intensity in an image file, scaled over specified dimensions.
- Pointclouds via `add_pointcloud()` in `vamp.Environment`. This will construct a CAPT from the provided list of points, the minimum and maximum robot sphere radii, and radius for each point in the pointcloud.
See the `src/impl/vamp/collision/` folder for more information.

Some robots (currently, the UR5, Panda, and Fetch) support attaching custom geometry (a collection of spheres) to the end-effector via `vamp.Attachment(relative_position, relative_quaternion_xyzw)`.
Spheres can be added (in the attachment's frame) with `add_sphere(...)`.
The attachment can be added to the environment with `vamp.Environment.attach(...)`, and removed with `vamp.Environment.detach()`.
An example use of attachments with the Panda arm is available in `scripts/attachments.py`.


## Code Overview

The code lives in the `src` folder, split into `impl` (the C++ core) and `vamp` (the Python interface).
Scripts live in the `scripts/` folder; see the [README](scripts/README.md) in that directory for more information.

Inside `impl/vamp`, the code is divided into the following directories:
- `vector.hh` and `vector/`:
  Our abstract SIMD interface that underpins much of the core C++ library.
  The interface for these types is described in `interface.hh`, and the actual implementations of the operations for specific instruction sets are in `avx.hh` (for x86 AVX2) and `neon.hh` (for ARM NEON).
- `bindings/`:
  Python bindings, via [nanobind](https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind).
  The main module is described starting in `python.cc`, with code separated out logically for more efficient compilation.
  `common.hh` is a templated helper that is used to create each robot's submodule.

- `random/`:
  Pseudorandom number generation, e.g., `halton.hh` for the SIMD Halton generator.

- `collision/`:
  Collision checking routines and environment description.
  Primitives are described in `shapes.hh`, the methods to create them in `factory.hh`, the environment in `environment.hh`, and collision checking of spheres against the environment in `validity.hh`.
  CAPTs are implemented in `capt.hh`, with pointcloud filtering in `filter.hh`.

- `planning/`:
  Planning and simplification routines.
  `rrtc.hh` and `rrtc_settings.hh` are for our RRT-Connect implementation.
  `prm.hh` and `roadmap.hh` are for our PRM implementation.
  `simplify.hh` and `simplify_settings.hh` are for simplification heuristics.
  `validate.hh` contains the raked motion validator.

- `robots/`:
  Robot specific code.
  Each named subfolder contains `fk.hh` for each robot, which contains the automatically generated code from the tracing compiler.
  The named `{robot}.hh` folder at the top is a helper struct which maps `fk.hh` routines and other robot-specific information.
